## George Michael

But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore? No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. Really? Did nothing cancel? First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians.

## Buster Bluth

Really? Did nothing cancel? No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide. Marry me. Army had half a day.

## Lucille Bluth

I'm half machine. I'm a monster. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore? No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.
